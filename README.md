#Crime Incident Classification NLP Model
This project aims to classify crime incidents into predefined categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing descriptions of crime incidents and categorizes them based on the provided information.

#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify crime descriptions into the correct category and subcategory. The model leverages a variety of NLP techniques, including text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification algorithms, to analyze and categorize unstructured crime data.

#Features:
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and text cleaning to prepare the data for modeling.
Machine Learning Models: The project includes multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and more.
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are calculated to evaluate model performance.
Technologies Used
Python (Programming Language)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Pandas (Data Manipulation)
NLTK (Text Preprocessing)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data Visualization)

#Dataset
The dataset consists of crime incident descriptions, which are classified into various categories and subcategories. The data includes a variety of text data, including crime details, incidents, and related information that need to be classified.
